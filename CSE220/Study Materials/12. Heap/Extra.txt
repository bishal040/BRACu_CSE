There are many other types of tree data strutures like `Radix Tree`, `AVL`, `Trie` etc. We use these trees in our day to day lives without even realizing when or where. Once you're comfortable with `BST` and `Heap` then you should move on and try to implement the other types of trees as well.

Check out the following simulations to play around with few other types of trees.
1.   [AVL tree simulation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
2.   [Patricia Tree simulation](https://blockchain-academy.hs-mittweida.de/patricia-tree-simulator)
3.   [Radix tree simulation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RadixTree.html) (Works with alphabetic words only)
4.   [Trie/Prefix-tree simulation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Trie.html) (Works with alphabetic words only)
5.   [Suffix-tree simulation](https://visualgo.net/en/suffixtree) (you'll deal with this in **CSE221**)
